# Retail-71 dataset for Domain Adaptation
We introduce Retail-71 whose source domain contains clean images of diverse products commonly seen in market or convenience store, while its target domain broods images in which hand occlusion and motion blur exist. The domain shift between source and target domain is mainly from hand occlusion and motion blur, as well as a difference in background, resolution, lighting, device used to collect images, and so on.
Unlike other existing benchmarks, Retail-71 includes its test set with three difficulties, i.e. easy, medium, and hard level. Harder test set contains the test samples with more intensified motion blur and hand occlusion.
